Generate images with WGAN using a meta-learning algorithm (Reptile) to learn quickly

The first step of this project is to train a deep antagonistic generative network with the use of a scalable meta-learning algorithm ([Reptile](https://openai.com/blog/reptile/): takes in a distribution of tasks, where each task is a learning problem, and it produces a quick learner â€” a learner that can generalize from a small number of examples) on different datasets: each meta-learning task corresponds to a different dataset. Once you have trained this model, you can go to a classic training phase through a fine-tuning, to evaluate the performance and accuracy (WIP).
